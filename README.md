## Problem Statement

*Problem Statement ID â€“ PY041*

Many two-wheeler riders violate traffic rules by not wearing helmets, leading to increased road accidents and fatalities. Additionally, identifying such violations and capturing the corresponding vehicle details manually is inefficient and error-prone. The challenge is to develop a system that can automatically detect riders without helmets in real-world traffic conditions, capture their vehicle's license plate, and extract the plate number for further processing. This must be done accurately despite variations in lighting, motion blur, occlusions, and complex urban traffic scenarios.

## Overview
The solution utilizes a deep learning-based object detection model to identify riders without helmets and capture their vehicle's license plate. The system works as follows:

Helmet Detection â€“ A trained YOLO-based model processes video feeds to detect riders and classify them as wearing or not wearing helmets.

License Plate Detection â€“ If a violation is detected, the system isolates the vehicleâ€™s license plate from the frame.

Text Extraction â€“ Optical Character Recognition (OCR) or AI-based text recognition extracts the license plate number from the detected plate.

Data Logging â€“ The detected violations, along with the timestamp and extracted plate number, are stored for further analysis and legal action.
The system aims to improve traffic rule enforcement, reduce manual effort, and enhance road safety by ensuring strict adherence to helmet laws.
